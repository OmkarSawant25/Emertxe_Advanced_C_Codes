1. Static Declaration of 2D Array
  ðŸ”¹ Key Points to Remember
    âœ… Size fixed at compile time
    âœ… Stored in stack memory
    âœ… Faster access than dynamic arrays
    âœ… Can be partially initialized
    âœ… Stored in row-major order

2. Dynamic 2D Arrays in C -> Array of Pointers (Row-wise Allocation)
  ðŸ”¹ Key Points to Remember
    âœ… Each row is a separate array, pointed to by an array of pointers.
    âœ… Memory: Heap (allocated with malloc)
    âœ… Access: arr[i][j] (easy and natural syntax)
    âœ… Dynamic Size: Both rows and columns can be determined at runtime.
    âœ… Memory Layout: Rows can be non-contiguous.
    âœ… Free Memory: Must free each row, then the array of pointers.
    âœ… Pros: Easy syntax, flexible, supports jagged arrays (different row lengths)
    âœ… Cons: Slightly slower than contiguous memory for large arrays
